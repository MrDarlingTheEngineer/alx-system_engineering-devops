An application programming interface is a set of tools, routines and protocols that are used by developers to create a software
application.

An API specifies how software components interact with each other.

Developers usually break up their application into multiple servers that communicate to each other via APIs.
The servers that perform helper functions for the main application server are called microservices.

Most common APIs include Google Maps API, You Tube API, Twitter API, Flickr API, and Amazon Product Advertising API.
